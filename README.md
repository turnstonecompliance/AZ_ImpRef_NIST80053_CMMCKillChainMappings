# Turnstone Compliance | CMMC 2.0 Kill Chain + Microsoft Technical Reference Guide
This is a cross-mapping of Compliance Forgeâ€™s CMMC Kill Chain (based on NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2) and the Microsoft Technical Reference Guide for CMMC 2.0. The intention of this documentation is for use with Microsoft-native or Azure environments (GCC/GCCH) to provide a high level listing of available services within the Microsoft platform to be used effectively for organizations seeking or obtaining CMMC Level 2 certification from a C3PAO.
